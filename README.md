# ember-cli-copyright

ember-cli-copyright is a revolutionary ember-cli addon allowing you to never update the copyright year on your ember cli applications footer again.

## Installation

The best way to install is to use the ember-cli install:addon command like this.

Are there other ways? I really don't konw. 

## Usage

In your application's footer add the following
